## 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing - Bash Project


## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum and focuses on fundamental concepts of Bash scripting, including loops, conditions, and parsing. The project includes multiple tasks that help you practice and master these essential skills.

# Tasks
# Task 0: Create an SSH RSA Key Pair
# Requirements:

# Create an RSA key pair.
Share your public key in the 0-RSA_public_key.pub file.
Fill the SSH public key field of your intranet profile with the generated public key.
Keep the private key secure for future SSH server access.
You can optionally add a passphrase to the key, but remember to store it securely.
Task 1: For Best School Loop
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.
Task 2: While Best School Loop
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.
Task 3: Until Best School Loop
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.
Task 4: If 9, Say Hi!
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.
On the 9th iteration, display "Hi" on a new line using an if statement.
Task 5: 4 Bad Luck, 8 Is Your Chance
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10.
Display "bad luck" on the 4th iteration and "good luck" on the 8th iteration.
For all other iterations, display "Best School."
Use a while loop and if, elif, and else statements.
Task 6: Superstitious Numbers
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20.
Display "bad luck from China" on the 4th iteration.
Display "bad luck from Japan" on the 9th iteration.
Display "bad luck from Italy" on the 17th iteration.
Use a while loop and case statements.
Task 7: Clock
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes.
Display hours from 0 to 12.
Display minutes from 1 to 59.
Use a while loop and consider using the head command to limit output.
Task 8: For ls
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays the content of the current directory.
List only filenames, removing the part before the first dash (if present).
Exclude hidden files from the list.
Use a for loop.
Task 9: To File, or Not to File
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that checks if a file named "school" exists.
If it exists, check if it's empty and whether it's a regular file.
Display appropriate messages based on the file's status.
Use if and else statements.
Task 10: FizzBuzz
Requirements:

Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100.
Display "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
Use a for loop and conditional statements.
Getting Started
To run these scripts, follow these general steps:

Clone the project repository from the ALX GitHub account.
Navigate to the appropriate task directory (e.g., 1-for_best_school) using the command line.
Run the Bash script by entering ./script-name (e.g., ./1-for_best_school) and observe the output.
Remember to review each task's specific requirements in its description.
