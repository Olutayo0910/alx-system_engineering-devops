Explanation of the Infrastructure:

Load Balancer:

The load balancer (HAproxy) is introduced to distribute incoming web traffic between two servers, Server1 and Server2. This ensures high availability and load distribution.
Distribution Algorithm: The load balancer is configured with a round-robin algorithm, distributing requests evenly between the two servers.
Server1 and Server2:

Two servers are added for redundancy and to eliminate the Single Point of Failure (SPOF).
Active-Active Setup: Both servers are actively serving requests, making it an Active-Active setup. This means both servers are engaged in processing user requests simultaneously.
Web Server:

Nginx acts as the web server, handling incoming HTTP requests.
Nginx routes requests to the application server and serves static content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Application Server:

The application server executes server-side code (your codebase) to generate dynamic content.
It communicates with the database to retrieve or store data.
Sends responses back to the web server, which delivers content to users' browsers.
Database Primary and Replica:

MySQL is used for the database. A Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster is implemented for data replication.
Data synchronization: The Primary node handles write operations, while the Replica node replicates data from the Primary node for read operations.
Data consistency and failover: In the event of Primary node failure, the Replica can be promoted to Primary to ensure continuous database operation.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Although Server1 and Server2 are added for redundancy, a single load balancer remains a potential SPOF. Consider implementing a secondary load balancer for high availability.
Security Issues:

Security concerns include the absence of a firewall to protect the servers and the lack of HTTPS, which is essential for securing data in transit. Implement a firewall and SSL/TLS for encryption.
No Monitoring:

The infrastructure lacks a monitoring system to track the performance and health of servers, web applications, and databases. Monitoring tools are necessary to identify and address issues promptly.
In summary, this infrastructure design introduces redundancy, load balancing, and a Primary-Replica database cluster for high availability and data consistency. However, it still has some critical issues that need to be addressed, including the SPOF, security, and the absence of monitoring.
