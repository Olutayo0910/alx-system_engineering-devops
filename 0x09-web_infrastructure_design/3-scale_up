Front-end Load Balancer (HAproxy Cluster):

Two front-end load balancers (HAproxy) configured as a cluster.
They distribute incoming requests and provide redundancy.
Primary Servers:

One web server, one application server, and one database server serve as primary servers.
Backup Server:

A single backup server that can serve as a failover for the web server, application server, and database server in case any of the primary servers experience issues.
Firewalls:

Four firewalls placed strategically to secure the network and protect against unauthorized access and threats.
SSL Certificate:

The SSL certificate is installed on the load balancers to encrypt traffic and ensure secure communication.
Monitoring Clients:

Four monitoring clients (data collectors) are deployed to collect data related to system health, performance, and security.
Specifics about the Infrastructure:

Front-end Load Balancers (HAproxy Cluster):

Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across primary servers for load distribution and high availability.
Configured as a cluster to ensure redundancy. If one load balancer fails, the other takes over.
Primary Servers:

The web server serves static content.
The application server manages server-side code for dynamic content.
The database server stores and manages application data.
Backup Server:

The backup server is capable of serving as a failover for the web server, application server, and database server in case any of the primary servers experience issues.
Firewalls:

Firewalls are placed at critical network points to enforce security policies and protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access and threats.
SSL Certificate:

The SSL certificate is installed on the load balancers to enable secure, encrypted communication between clients and the infrastructure.
Monitoring Clients:

Monitoring clients are responsible for collecting data on system health, performance, and security. They help identify and address issues proactively.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

While the backup server enhances redundancy for all primary servers, it's important to ensure proper failover configurations and monitoring to minimize the risk of a single point of failure.
Scalability Limitations:

Scaling might be a challenge when handling a significant increase in incoming traffic. Adding more servers and optimizing the load balancers may be required.
Security:

The infrastructure includes firewalls and SSL encryption to enhance security, but additional security measures like firewall rules and monitoring are essential.
Monitoring:

Monitoring tools and processes should be in place to ensure system health, performance, and security.
