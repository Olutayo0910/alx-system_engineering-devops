# Webstack Monitoring Project (0x18)

## Overview

This project focuses on web stack monitoring, a critical aspect of DevOps and SysAdmin responsibilities. By implementing monitoring tools, we aim to gather data about running software and server performance, ensuring that systems behave as expected.

## Project Details

- **Project Name:** Webstack Monitoring
- **Domain:** DevOps, SysAdmin
- **Tags:** Monitoring, Server
- **Weight:** 1

## Project Timeline

- **Start Date:** January 17, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** January 18, 2024, 6:00 AM


## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to delve into the following concepts:

1. **Monitoring:** Understanding the significance of monitoring in the tech industry.
2. **Server:** Exploring the monitoring of virtual or physical servers, focusing on aspects like CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

## Background Context

"You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure" - a profound saying in the tech industry. In the era of data-ism, monitoring the performance of our software systems is paramount. This project addresses the implementation of tools to measure server health and application behavior.

## Project Objectives

The Webstack Monitoring project comprises two main categories:

1. **Application Monitoring:**
   - Gathering data about running software.
   - Ensuring software behaves as expected.

2. **Server Monitoring:**
   - Gathering data about virtual or physical servers.
   - Ensuring servers are not overloaded in terms of CPU, memory, disk, or network usage.
