# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Resolved Swiftly

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
The outage occurred on January 14, 2024, from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM (UTC).

**Impact:**  
The outage affected the core authentication service, resulting in a 30% reduction in overall platform functionality. Users experienced slow response times and, in some cases, complete unavailability.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancing settings, leading to an overload on the authentication servers.

## Timeline

**Issue Detection:**  
The issue was initially detected at 3:00 PM when monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates.

**Actions Taken:**  
1. The operations team investigated the authentication service logs to identify the issue promptly.
2. Initial assumption: A DDoS attack was suspected due to the sudden surge in traffic.
3. Investigations were initiated on the network infrastructure and firewall logs to trace the source of the traffic.

**Misleading Paths:**  
1. A false lead was followed when a recent software deployment was considered as the potential cause, diverting resources temporarily.
2. Further investigation into DDoS attacks consumed valuable time until it was ruled out with the help of network traffic analysis.

**Escalation:**  
As the issue persisted, it was escalated to the DevOps team for a deeper analysis of the system architecture.

**Resolution:**  
At 6:30 PM, the team identified the misconfiguration in the load balancing settings, promptly rectified it, and initiated a system-wide reboot. Normal service was restored within minutes.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The misconfiguration in the load balancing settings led to an uneven distribution of incoming traffic across the authentication servers. Some servers were overwhelmed, resulting in delayed or failed authentication requests.

**Resolution:**  
The configuration error was corrected by redistributing the load evenly among all authentication servers. This was followed by a system-wide reboot to ensure the changes took effect immediately.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
1. Strengthen monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into server loads and traffic patterns.
2. Implement automated alerts for abnormal spikes in error rates or traffic.
3. Enhance documentation to facilitate quicker identification of misconfigurations during troubleshooting.

**Tasks:**  
1. Update load balancing configurations to prevent a recurrence of uneven server loads.
2. Conduct a comprehensive review of recent software deployments to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. Introduce regular training sessions for operations and DevOps teams on identifying and resolving load-related issues.

In conclusion, the web stack outage was swiftly addressed by a collaborative effort from the operations and DevOps teams. The incident highlighted the importance of robust monitoring systems, rapid response protocols, and continuous training to mitigate the impact of potential issues. The corrective measures undertaken will not only prevent the recurrence of similar incidents but also strengthen the overall resilience of our web infrastructure.
